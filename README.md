Mohammad D. Abdulmanan, a third-year IT student from St. Michael’s College, and I’m the creator of the Stuart Boutique Online Ordering and Inventory System. This project was completed and deployed in January 2025 to help Stuart Boutique modernize its operations and provide better service to its customers.

Stuart Boutique, located at Torralba St., Iligan City, is known for its stylish fashion items, including clothes, shoes, and accessories. The system I designed makes managing inventory and processing online orders simple and efficient. It helps the boutique staff track items, monitor stock, and generate reports while giving customers an easy way to browse and shop online.
